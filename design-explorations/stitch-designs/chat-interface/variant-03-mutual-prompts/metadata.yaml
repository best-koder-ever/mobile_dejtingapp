  ⭐ BREAKTHROUGH FEATURE - Mutual conversation starters!
  
  **The Problem This Solves:**
  Users get stuck in "hello, how are you" small talk and conversations die.
  One-sided AI suggestions feel pushy.
  
  **The Solution:**
  Conversation Starter Cards that BOTH people engage with together.
  
  **How It Works:**
  
  1. **Card in Chat Flow:**
     - Appears naturally in the message thread
     - Soft purple-tinted background with glowing border
     - Sparkle icon ✨ and "💭 Ice Breaker Question" header
  
  2. **The Question:**
     - "What's your go-to comfort food?"
     - (Other examples: "Most memorable travel experience?", "Hidden talent?")
  
  3. **Side-by-Side Answers:**
     - Left: "Sophia: Homemade Ramen 🍜" ✓
     - Right: "You: Authentic Tacos 🌮" ✓
     - Equal visual weight - collaborative, not competitive
     - Green checkmarks when both answered
  
  4. **Next Question Button:**
     - "Next Question ➡️" at bottom of card
     - Loads another prompt when both want more
  
  5. **Natural Flow:**
     - Regular messages above and below
     - Card doesn't interrupt - feels like shared discovery
     - Can have multiple cards in one conversation
  
  **Design Details:**
  - Purple theme (#7f13ec) maintained
  - Plus Jakarta Sans typography
  - Sent bubbles: purple gradient
  - Received bubbles: light gray
  - Card has subtle elevation/shadow
  - Typing indicator below
  - Clean input bar with send button

strengths:
  - COLLABORATIVE not one-sided - both people participate equally
  - Breaks the "hello how are you" ice naturally
  - Answers build connection and shared knowledge
  - Feels playful and game-like (not forced)
  - Cards flow in conversation - don't block or interrupt
  - Can see what you both answered - easy comparison
  - "Next Question" keeps momentum going
  - Reduces pressure - structured prompts easier than freeform
  - Great for introverts or shy users
  - Creates conversation topics organically

concerns:
  - How to decide WHEN to show a prompt card?
  - Who triggers "Next Question" - either person or both?
  - What if one person ignores the prompt?
  - Need large question database (100+ prompts)
  - Prompt quality critical - boring questions kill engagement
  - May feel juvenile if not executed well
  - Privacy: are answers saved/shared beyond this chat?

comparison_with_other_variants:
  variant_01_coral:
    - Traditional chat only
    - No conversation help
  variant_02_futuristic:
    - One-sided AI suggestions ("Ask about trip to Japan")
    - Asymmetric - only helps one person
    - Can feel pushy
  variant_03_mutual_prompts:
    - Both people answer together
    - Symmetric and collaborative
    - Natural ice-breaker tool
    - Less pressure than freeform

implementation_approach:
  backend:
    - Prompt database with categories (travel, food, hobbies, values)
    - API endpoint: GET /conversation-prompts/next?chat_id=123
    - Store both answers in chat thread
    - Track which prompts already shown in this chat
  
  frontend:
    - Card widget that inserts in message stream
    - Text input for answer (replaced with checkmark + answer when submitted)
    - "Next Question" button shows new prompt
    - Animation: card slides in gently when triggered
  
  timing_triggers:
    - Option 1: User manually taps "Ice Breaker" button in chat
    - Option 2: Auto-suggest after 5 messages if conversation slowing
    - Option 3: Show at match time: "Break the ice with a question!"
  
  prompt_categories:
    - Light & Fun: comfort food, weekend plans, coffee order
    - Travel: best trip, dream destination, most unusual place
    - Personality: hidden talent, morning/night person, superpower
    - Deeper: life philosophy, proudest accomplishment, scary thing done
  
  gamification:
    - "You've answered 10 prompts together! 🎉"
    - Unlock new categories after X prompts
    - Share favorite prompt answers on profile

alternative_variants:
  - variant-04-prompt-gallery: Full screen to browse all available prompts
  - variant-05-voice-prompts: Audio responses instead of text
  - variant-06-photo-prompts: "Show me your comfort food!" with photo answers

next_steps:
  - Build prompt database (start with 50 diverse questions)
  - User test: do people actually answer? Which prompts work best?
  - A/B test: manual trigger vs auto-suggest timing
  - Design full "Ice Breaker Library" screen (Stitch suggestion!)
  - Consider "Shared Moments" gallery of all answered prompts

user_feedback_addressed:
  - "not something that get in between the conversation" → Card flows naturally in thread ✓
  - "for both, not just one side" → Side-by-side answers, equal participation ✓
  - "keeps thing more flowing" → Next Question button, structured prompts ✓
  - "both can answer same question" → That's the core mechanic ✓
  - "see each other's answers" → Displayed side-by-side in card ✓
  - "get to know each other" → Prompts reveal personality, interests ✓
  - "not stuck in hello how are you" → Skips small talk, goes deeper ✓
