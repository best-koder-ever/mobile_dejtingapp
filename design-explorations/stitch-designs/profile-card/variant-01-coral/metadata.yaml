# Design notes
notes: |
  First AI-generated design from Google Stitch. This became our production ProfileCard.
  
  Key features:
  - Large portrait photo (3:4 aspect ratio)
  - Dark gradient overlay at bottom (ensures text readability)
  - Purple gradient "92% match" badge (top-right)
  - Bold white typography: "Sophia, 24"
  - Semi-transparent bio text
  - 3 circular action buttons: Pass (white/X), Like (red/heart), Super Like (teal/star)
  - Material Design shadows and elevation
  - Hover animations on buttons
  
  Generated with prompt: "Create a modern dating app profile card for mobile..."

strengths:
  - Professional gradient overlay solves text readability on varied photo backgrounds
  - Clear visual hierarchy (photo → name → bio → actions)
  - Match badge is attention-grabbing but not overwhelming
  - Action buttons follow industry standards (Tinder/Bumble pattern)
  - Plus Jakarta Sans typography is modern and readable

concerns:
  - 3:4 aspect ratio crops some photos significantly
  - Match badge position might conflict with photo composition in some cases
  - Super Like button color (teal) doesn't align with brand purple
  - No dark mode variant yet

alternative_variants:
  - variant-02-purple: Stronger purple theme, Material 3 tokens
  - variant-03-minimal: Cleaner design with less overlay
  - variant-04-dark: Dark mode optimized version
