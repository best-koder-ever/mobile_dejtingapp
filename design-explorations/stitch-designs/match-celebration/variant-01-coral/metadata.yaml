# Design notes
notes: |
  Second AI-generated design from Google Stitch. Created to match the ProfileCard aesthetic.
  
  Key features:
  - Dark background (#191022) matching ProfileCard dark mode
  - Two circular profile photos side-by-side with purple glow effect
  - Large "It's a Match!" heading in white bold text
  - Subtitle: "You and Sophia liked each other"
  - Primary action: "Send Message" button (purple gradient #7f13ec)
  - Secondary action: "Keep Swiping" button (white outline)
  - Plus Jakarta Sans typography (consistent with ProfileCard)
  - Material shadows and rounded corners matching ProfileCard style
  
  Generated with prompt: "Create a 'It's a Match!' celebration screen matching the profile card design style..."

strengths:
  - Consistent theme with ProfileCard (same purple, same typography, same shadows)
  - Clear visual hierarchy (photos → heading → subtitle → actions)
  - Purple glow around photos creates celebration feel without animation
  - Two action choices give user control (message now vs continue browsing)
  - Dark background focuses attention on the match

concerns:
  - Static design without animation (real implementation should add confetti/sparkles)
  - May need "Close" button in top-right for users who want to dismiss quickly
  - Profile photo size could be larger for more impact
  - Secondary button (Keep Swiping) might reduce message conversion rate

alternative_variants:
  - variant-02-animated: Add confetti animation, pulsing photos
  - variant-03-minimal: Simpler layout with single "Say Hi" button
  - variant-04-fullscreen: Larger photos, full-bleed background

next_steps:
  - Add to Flutter as dialog/full-screen modal
  - Implement with animation (confetti particles, fade-in)
  - A/B test single vs dual action buttons
  - Consider haptic feedback on display
