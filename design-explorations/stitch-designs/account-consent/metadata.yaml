description: |
  Account consent and language selection screen that appears after OAuth
  (Google/Phone/Apple) login but before the profile creation wizard.
  Critical for GDPR compliance and language preference collection.

features:
  - OAuth account confirmation (shows user email/name)
  - "Use another account" option
  - Legal consent text with clickable Privacy/Terms links
  - Language selector (Svenska/English)
  - Footer help/privacy/terms links
  - Prominent "Continue" CTA button
  - Back and close navigation

flow:
  - User clicks "Continue with Google" on Welcome Screen
  - Google OAuth flow (handled by Google)
  - User lands on THIS screen (account consent)
  - User reviews account, reads policies, selects language
  - User clicks "Continue"
  - Proceeds to Wizard Basic Info (Step 1/3)

implementation_status: flutter_implemented
flutter_widget_path: lib/screens/account_consent_screen.dart

design_decisions:
  - Implemented directly in Flutter (Stitch unavailable during creation)
  - Follows Tinder's consent screen pattern (industry standard)
  - Bilingual (Swedish primary, English fallback)
  - Links to privacy/terms REQUIRED by GDPR
  - "Use another account" allows changing OAuth account

strengths:
  - GDPR compliant (informed consent with policy links)
  - Professional OAuth UX pattern
  - Clear language selection
  - Matches DejTing brand (coral/purple gradient)
  - Fully functional implementation ready

concerns:
  - ⚠️ Privacy/Terms URLs must be real before launch (see LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md)
  - Need actual OAuth integration (Google/Apple/Phone)
  - Language preference must sync to backend
  - Should add more languages post-MVP (Norwegian, Danish, Finnish)

missing_from_stitch:
  - Stitch was unavailable, so no AI-generated mockup exists
  - Consider generating Stitch design later for design system consistency
  - Current Flutter implementation can serve as reference

estimated_stitch_prompt: |
  "Create mobile account consent screen for dating app. Clean white background,
  app logo at top, 'Choose an account' heading, user profile card with photo/email,
  legal text with underlined privacy/terms links, Swedish/English language dropdown,
  help/privacy/terms footer links, coral-purple gradient Continue button. 
  Professional, minimal design like Tinder OAuth consent screen."
