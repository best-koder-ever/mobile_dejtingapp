# 🔧 GitHub Actions Pipeline Issues & Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Found in Pipeline:**

### **1. Critical Error: Deprecated Actions**
```
##[error]This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`
```

### **2. Missing Service Projects**
```
MSBUILD : error MSB1009: Project file does not exist.
Switch: photo-service/photo-service.sln
Switch: user-service/user-service.sln
Switch: swipe-service/swipe-service.sln
```

### **3. Wrong Repository Structure**
The pipeline expects .NET services in the Flutter app repo, but they're in separate repositories.

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied:**

### **✅ Fix 1: Update Deprecated Actions**
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 → v4
- Updated `actions/download-artifact` from v3 → v4
- Updated `actions/setup-dotnet` from v3 → v4

### **✅ Fix 2: Fix Repository Structure**
The pipeline was trying to find .NET services in the Flutter repo. Fixed by:
- Making pipeline Flutter-focused for the mobile app repo
- Separate CI/CD configs for microservices in their respective repos

### **✅ Fix 3: Simplified Pipeline**
- Flutter app repo: Flutter tests only
- Microservice repos: Individual .NET testing
- Removed cross-repo dependencies
