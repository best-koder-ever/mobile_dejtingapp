# 🔧 GitHub Actions Pipeline Issues & Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Found in Pipeline:**

### **1. Critical Error: Deprecated Actions**

```
##[error]This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`
```

### **2. Missing Service Projects**

```
MSBUILD : error MSB1009: Project file does not exist.
Switch: photo-service/photo-service.sln
Switch: user-service/user-service.sln
Switch: swipe-service/swipe-service.sln
```

### **3. Wrong Repository Structure**

The pipeline expects .NET services in the Flutter app repo, but they're in separate repositories.

---

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied:**

### **✅ Fix 1: Update Deprecated Actions**

- Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 → v4
- Updated `actions/download-artifact` from v3 → v4
- Updated `actions/setup-dotnet` from v3 → v4

### **✅ Fix 2: Fix Repository Structure**

The pipeline was trying to find .NET services in the Flutter repo. Fixed by:

- Making pipeline Flutter-focused for the mobile app repo
- Separate CI/CD configs for microservices in their respective repos

### **✅ Fix 3: Simplified Pipeline**

- Flutter app repo: Flutter tests only
- Microservice repos: Individual .NET testing
- Removed cross-repo dependencies

- ❌ Missing .NET service files → ✅ Removed .NET dependencies
- ❌ Wrong repository structure → ✅ Flutter-focused pipeline

---

---

## ✅ **FINAL RESOLUTION:**

### **🎯 Root Cause Found:**

The final issue was **Flutter/Dart version incompatibility**:

- App requires: **Dart SDK ^3.7.2**
- Workflow used: **Flutter 3.24.1** (with Dart 3.5.1)
- Error: `Because dejtingapp requires SDK version ^3.7.2, version solving failed`

### **🔧 Final Fix Applied:**

```yaml
name: "🚀 Flutter Mobile App CI/CD"
jobs:
  flutter_analysis:
    steps:
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: "3.35.2" # ✅ Updated for Dart 3.7.2
```

### **📊 Complete Resolution Summary:**

- ❌ Deprecated actions/upload-artifact@v3 → ✅ Updated to v4
- ❌ Missing .NET service files → ✅ Removed .NET dependencies
- ❌ Wrong repository structure → ✅ Flutter-only pipeline
- ❌ Flutter/Dart version mismatch → ✅ Updated to Flutter 3.35.2

### **🎉 Pipeline Status:**

- ✅ **Clean Flutter-only workflow**
