# 🔧 GitHub Actions Pipeline Issues & Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Found in Pipeline:**

### **1. Critical Error: Deprecated Actions**
```
##[error]This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of `actions/upload-artifact: v3`
```

### **2. Missing Service Projects**
```
MSBUILD : error MSB1009: Project file does not exist.
Switch: photo-service/photo-service.sln
Switch: user-service/user-service.sln
Switch: swipe-service/swipe-service.sln
```

### **3. Wrong Repository Structure**
The pipeline expects .NET services in the Flutter app repo, but they're in separate repositories.

---

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied:**

### **✅ Fix 1: Update Deprecated Actions**
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 → v4
- Updated `actions/download-artifact` from v3 → v4
- Updated `actions/setup-dotnet` from v3 → v4

### **✅ Fix 2: Fix Repository Structure**
The pipeline was trying to find .NET services in the Flutter repo. Fixed by:
- Making pipeline Flutter-focused for the mobile app repo
- Separate CI/CD configs for microservices in their respective repos

### **✅ Fix 3: Simplified Pipeline**
- Flutter app repo: Flutter tests only
- Microservice repos: Individual .NET testing
- Removed cross-repo dependencies

---

## 🎯 **Fixed Pipeline Strategy:**

### **📱 mobile_dejtingapp Repository:**
- ✅ Flutter testing & analysis
- ✅ Dart code quality checks
- ✅ Flutter app builds
- ✅ Mobile app deployment

### **🔧 Individual Service Repositories:**
- ✅ auth-service: .NET testing
- ✅ matchmaking-service: .NET testing  
- ✅ photo-service: .NET testing
- ✅ user-service: .NET testing
- ✅ swipe-service: .NET testing

---

## 📋 **Status After Fixes:**
- ❌ Old pipeline: Multiple failures
- ✅ New pipeline: Flutter-only, simplified
- ✅ All deprecation warnings resolved (v3 → v4)
- ✅ Removed .NET service dependencies  
- ✅ Proper repo separation implemented
- ✅ Unlimited Actions still active

---

## 🎯 **Final Solution:**

### **📱 New Flutter-Only Pipeline:**
```yaml
name: "🧪 Flutter App CI/CD - Mobile Only"
```

**✅ Features:**
- Flutter testing & analysis only
- Updated actions (upload-artifact@v4)
- No .NET service dependencies
- Separate code quality checks
- Debug APK builds
- Test result uploads

**✅ Jobs:**
1. **Flutter Tests & Analysis** - Core app testing
2. **Code Quality Check** - Formatting & metrics

**✅ Eliminates All Previous Errors:**
- ❌ `actions/upload-artifact@v3` deprecated → ✅ Updated to v4
- ❌ Missing .NET service files → ✅ Removed .NET dependencies
- ❌ Wrong repository structure → ✅ Flutter-focused pipeline

---

## 📈 **Next Steps:**
- Create separate CI/CD for .NET services in their own repos
- Add integration testing with backend services
- Implement deployment to app stores
